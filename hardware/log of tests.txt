8 or 7 bits, testing RAM unit, before BRAM, just registers:
    implementation sim:
        7 bits: 8 ns delay from mem_op_waiting to mem_op_ready
        8 bits: 8 ns delay from mem_op_waiting to mem_op_ready

    report power:
        7 bits: thermal margin -18.9c (-5.1 W), confidence level: Low
        8 bits: exactly the same
    
    report utilization:
        7 bits: LUT 6.02%, FF 3.16%, IO 31.33%
        8 bits: exactly the same

    schematic:
        7 bits: a bunch of registers
        8 bits: exactly the same
results:
    inconclusive. i think they're exactly the same. since 8 bits are easier to work with, i'll stick to it.
