TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0 and clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_70Mhz_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT io_cont/proc_clk_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin instance_name/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive.
