# yuda_assembly

This project is a web-based assembly language interpreter/bare-metal runner for my teacher Yuda's Assembly/Machine code that is in base 10. It allows you to write and run Yuda's Assembly code directly in your browser.

Currently it has a cli instead of web based interface. the web based interface is currently not functional.

## Getting Started

The hardware requires vivado and the cmod-s7 fpga. if you replace the xdc constraint file with a fitting one for your fpga which also has a uart connection (through usb ideally) then you can use it too.
The website side is explained in the [website's readme](website/README.md)
